A,English,fluency,20,2,200,E,O,"I assumed they were mostly translations of Chinese newspaper articles, translated by a mix of English (US/UK) native speakers and often non-native speakers. Several must have been machine translations, I think, and some were so poor (e.g. E-7) that even Google Translate would do a better job :)"
B1,English,fluency,34,5,50,,O,
B2,English,fluency,11,14,120,E,,I would guess it was written by Chinese students.
C,English,fluency,13,6,140,I,U,"I initially thought that these were translated from Chinese into English, since all pertain to China. They read a bit like unedited translations from another language. But when you asked me who authored the text, now I'm thinking maybe it was you? Maybe they are for a class you are taking about China and you translated them into English from German or French? Unless you know Chinese? Or maybe one is a manual translation and the other was done with a software program?"
D,English,fluency,17,5,200,I,U,"20 percent of them were written very well with no errors -  But most of them were either very poorly written or with a tone that made it clear a non-native speaker wrote them.  There were a few articles that had words repeated or weird punctuation marks where they shouldn't have been, which is a classic machine error - even a non-native speaker wouldn't repeat words like that. "
E,Chinese,adequacy,8,15,200,E,O,"I have searched part of the content on line. These articles and sentences are written by journalists, reporters and commentators from different newspaper offices."
F,English,adequacy,5,4,200,E,O,"To answer your question, I am guessing a machine translated the content (basing this also on what I know about your research since I have looked you up as part of normal due diligence to determine if your request is likely genuine).  With some exceptions, the quality is mostly bad, similar to non-native Chinese translators translating Chinese to English - some of the same mistakes but also some nice idiomatic turns of phrase you don't expect to see in such work. However, there were many more objective errors than I'd expect to find. So the mix of errors makes me think they were all computer generated and none were human generated (though the odd sentence came very close to acceptable or was acceptable)."
G,Chinese,adequacy,12,4,200,I,U,"As to the translator of the texts, it is hard to tell. The A and B sessions are done by at least two translators. They have made mistakes in places that are common to native Chinese speaker, such as the usage of articles, i.e., ""the"" and ""a"". Some of the translation that were not chosen by me were done by very bad machine translation, worse than Google Translate. Most of the translations are pretty good with proper nouns though. "
H,"Chinese, English",adequacy,3,24,200,I,U,A journalist maybe.
