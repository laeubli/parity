ifeng0812.news.49766908_0,E-13,行业数据显示，2015年煤炭产能总规模接近60亿吨，全国煤炭产能过剩18亿吨。近十年来，国务院前后共发布过5次淘汰过剩与落后产能的通知。虽然前4次没有针对煤炭行业，但目标行业直接与煤炭业产生关系。去年11月到今年1月，秦皇岛5500大卡动力煤价格长期在370元/吨低位徘徊，90%的煤炭企业陷入亏损。而2月份以来，煤价逐步回升，近期秦皇岛动力煤价格更是连续上涨四周，上升到16个月来的高点，一度攀升到每吨436元，比年初上涨近70元。随着价格回升，各界担心随之产生：一批小煤矿会不会复工复产？对此，中国（海南）改革发展研究院经济所所长匡贤明进行了分析与解读。匡贤明：去产能引起了各方的高度关注，今天公布的煤炭行业去产能的成绩单也确实让大家感到比较担心。这三个表层的因素还是反映出了过去我们的增长方式转变相对滞后的原因，就是由政府主导的增长方式至今还没有得到根本性的转变。第二，这也与地方政府的推进力度直接相关，在去产能的过程中，资金和相应的配套措施都要到位，从这个方面看来，不同地区的差异确实比较大。第三，如果目前进度比较慢的一些省份要在下半年赶进度，它们可能会面临较大的风险。在这种情况下，依靠中央奖补资金来推进去产能的进程可能会产生一定负面的影响。首先，去产能不是简单的进行总量控制。我们的目的是要通过淘汰落后的产能，推进结构的优化，重构整个煤炭行业的新业态。在部署去产能的过程中，地方政府一定要把去产能和煤炭产业的转型升级结合起来，大力发展相关的服务业。第二，要想在今年年内完成今年的去产能任务，我们还是要充分发挥行政监督和行政监察的力量。最后，我们要加强社会保障的兜底作用。因为市场直接涉及到就业的问题，所以我们要加强对员工和职工的就业技能培训。,"Industry figures revealed that in 2015, coal production capacity totaled approximately 6 billion tonnes, with excess capacity of 1.8 billion tonnes nationwide. For nearly 10 years, the State Council of the People's Republic of China have announced 5 notices for eliminating redundant and obsolete production capacities. Although the coal industry was not the target in the first four times, the targeted industries were directly related to coal industry production. From November last year to January this year, the Qinhuangdao 5,500 kcal steam coal has been fluctuating around a price of 370 Yuan/ton, and 90% of coal industries are experiencing losses. Since February, coal prices have started to rebound. The price of steam coal at Qinhuangdao has risen for 4 consecutive weeks, reaching a peak during the last 16 months at a price of 436 Yuan per ton, a figure that almost rose by 70 Yuan compared to the start of the year. As prices rebound, concerns have arisen: Will some of the small coal mines resume production? Kuang Xianming, director of the China Institute for Reform and Development (Hainan), analyzed and interpreted this. Kuang Xianming: Elimination of excess capacity caught everyone's attention. The report card on the elimination of excess capacity in the coal industry announced today has indeed caused greater concern. These three superficial factors still reflect the lag in the change in our growth model, i.e., the government driven growth model has yet to experience a fundamental change to date. Second, it is directly related to the advance effort exerted by the local government. Cutting industrial overcapacity requires proper supportive measures which are varied in different places. Third, if some of the provinces which are currently progressing at a slower rate expect to catch up in the second half, they would face bigger risks. Under such straits, reliance on rewards and compensations from the central government to further increase production capacity will generate a certain degree of negative impact. First, removing production capacity is not simply controlling total volume. Our aim is to get rid of obsolete production capacity, achieve structural optimization, and re-organize the coal industry into a new business form. The local government, during the deployment of overcapacity cutting, shall combine the effort with the transformation of coal industry to drive the development of related service sector. Secondly, to complete the task of reducing production capacities this year, we must ensure thorough enforcement of our administrative supervision and administrative monitoring capacities. Finally, we must strengthen miscellaneous provisions and functions of social programs. As the market is directly related to employment issues, we must strengthen employable skill training for the employees and vocational workers.","Industry data show that total coal production capacity in 2015 was nearly 6 billion tons, with a national surplus of 1.8 billion tons of coal capacity. Over the past decade, the State Council has issued a total of five times before and after the elimination of excess and backward production capacity. Although the first four times did not target the coal industry, but the target industry has a direct relationship with the coal industry. Between November last year and January, Qinhuangdao's 5,500 kilocalories of thermal coal prices hovered at a low of 370 yuan / ton for a long time, with 90 percent of coal companies in the red. And since February, coal prices gradually recovered, the recent Qinhuangdao thermal coal prices rose for four consecutive weeks, rose to a 16-month high, once climbed to 436 yuan per ton, up nearly 70 yuan from the beginning of the year. As prices recovered, concerns arose about whether a group of small coal mines would return to work and return to production. In this regard, China (Hainan) Reform and Development Research Institute, Director of the Institute of Economics Kuang Xianming conducted analysis and interpretation. Quang Xianming: De-capacity has attracted a lot of attention from all sides, and today's announcement of the coal industry's report card for de-capacity has really made people feel more worried. These three superficial factors still reflect the fact that the transformation of our growth pattern has lagged behind in the past, that is, the government-led growth pattern has not yet been fundamentally transformed. Second, this is also directly related to the local government's efforts to promote, in the process of capacity removal, the funds and corresponding supporting measures have to be in place, from this perspective, the differences between different regions are indeed relatively large. Third, some provinces that are currently making slower progress may be at greater risk if they are to catch up in the second half of the year. In this case, relying on central incentive funds to advance the process of capacity removal may have a certain negative impact. First of all, capacity reduction is not simply a matter of total quantity control. Our aim is to reconfigure the new format of the entire coal industry by eliminating backward production capacity and promoting the optimization of the structure. In the process of deploying desalination capacity, local governments must combine desalination capacity with the transformation and upgrading of the coal industry and vigorously develop the relevant service industries. Second, if we want to complete this year's desalination task within this year, we still have to give full play to the strength of administrative supervision and administrative supervision. Finally, we should strengthen the role of social security. Because the market is directly related to the issue of employment, so we should strengthen the employment skills training for employees and workers.",

ifeng0812.news.49765988_0,E-15,8月12日上午，国务院新闻办就2016年7月份国民经济运行情况举行新闻发布会。国家统计局新闻发言人、国民经济综合统计司司长盛来运表示，7月份，国民经济部分指标增速有所放缓，但仍运行在合理区间。国家统计局发布的数据显示，7月份固定资产投资增速、进口总额等数据有所回落。盛来运说，关于7月份的国民经济运行情况，我想借用总理曾经讲过的一句话“形有波动，势仍向好”，这能够比较好地概括7月份的经济运行的特征。他解释“形有波动”是指7月份部分经济指标增速确实是有所回落。因为7月份国内外经济仍处在深度调整之中，国际形势复杂多变，世界经济的复苏不及预期，所以出口压力还是比较大。从国内情况看，整个经济还处在调整的关键阶段，调整的阵痛在释放，经济面临不小的下行压力，所以有些指标有些波动。盛来运指出，7月份还有一个特殊情况，洪涝灾害比较严重，高温酷暑天气对一些地区的生产经营带来了一些影响。根据民政部最近发布的情况，全国6000多万人受灾，直接经济损失超过2000亿元。从工业、投资、交通运输相关指标看，这些地区不同程度受到影响。7月份的货物周转运量增速比上月回落3.6个百分点，洪涝灾害对这些地区的交通有一定的影响。从这些因素来看，7月份部分指标出现波动也是很正常，也是在预期之中。他表示，“势仍向好”指的是尽管经济增速有所回落，但是经济运行总体平稳，稳中有进、稳中向好的大势没有变。7月份CPI上涨1.8%，环比上涨0.2%;1-7月份CPI上涨2.1%，所以物价形势总体稳定。,"On the morning of August 12, the State Council Information Office held a press conference on the operating conditions of the nation's economy in July 2016. Sheng Laiyun, National Bureau of Statistics Spokesman and Deputy Director-General of the Department of Comprehensive Statistics said that a number of national economic indicators grew at a slower rate in July but were still operating within a reasonable range. Figures from the National Bureau of Statistics revealed that fixed asset investment growth, total imports and other data declined again in July. Sheng Laiyun said, ""As far as the operating condition of the national economy in July is concerned, I would like to borrow a phrase from the Premier, and that is 'fluctuations exist but the trend remains positive'. This can better encapsulate the characteristics of the economy in July."" He explained that ""fluctuations exist in the trend"" refers to the fact that the growth rates of some of the July economic indicators have indeed declined. The pressure on exporting sector is still huge due to the  drastic adjustment of domestic and international economy in July, profound change of international situation and the  world economic recovery failed the expectation. Domestically, the entire economy is still going through adjustments, and some adverse reactions to this adjustment have surfaced. Some indicators may fluctuate as the economy faces significant downward pressure. Sheng Laiyun pointed out the occurrence of extraordinary events in July: floods were worse than usual, and the hot weather and high temperatures affected production and the operations of some regions. Latest information released by the Ministry of Civil Affairs showed that the disaster has affected over 60 million people and led to a direct economic loss of over 200 billion RMB. These regions have been affected to varying degrees based on relevant industrial, investment and transportation indicators. The growth in inventory turnover volume in July dropped 3.6% compared to last month. The flooding disaster has imposed a certain degree of influence to traffic in these areas. These factors show that volatility in some of the indicators in July is normal and within expectations. He said that the ""trend is still positive"" meant that although economic growth has decelerated, the economy was running steadily on the whole. The general trend of improvement amid stability and growing positively amid stability remained unchanged. CPI rose by 1.8% in July, and grew by 0.2% when compared to the previous period. CPI from January to July rose by 2.1%. These figures indicate that trends for commodity prices have, in general, remained steady.","On the morning of August 12, the Information Office of the State Council held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in July 2016. Sheng Laiyun, spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics and director of the General Statistics Department of the National Economy, said that the growth rate of some indicators of the national economy had slowed in July, but it was still operating within a reasonable range. Figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics show that the growth rate of fixed-asset investment and total imports fell in July. Sheng Laiyun said that with regard to the performance of the national economy in July, I would like to borrow a phrase once spoken by the Prime Minister, ""The situation is fluctuating and the trend is still positive,"" which can better summarize the characteristics of the economic operation in July. He explained that ""volatility"" refers to the fact that the growth rate of some economic indicators did decline in July. Because the domestic and foreign economies were still undergoing deep adjustment in July, the international situation was complicated and changeable, and the recovery of the world economy was less than expected, so the pressure on exports was still relatively strong. Domestically, the economy as a whole is still in the crucial stage of adjustment, the pain of adjustment is being released and the economy is facing considerable downward pressure, so some indicators are somewhat volatile. Sheng noted that there was also a special situation in July, with more severe flooding and severe heat, which had some impact on production and operations in some areas. According to a recent release by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people across the country have been affected by the disaster, with direct economic losses of more than 200 billion yuan. These areas are affected to varying degrees in terms of industrial, investment and transport-related indicators. The growth rate of goods turnover in July fell 3.6 percentage points from the previous month, with flooding having some impact on traffic in these areas. Judging from these factors, it is also normal and expected that some of the indicators will fluctuate in July. He said the ""trend is still positive"" refers to the fact that despite the slowdown in economic growth, the overall economic performance is stable, steady and positive trend has not changed. CPI rose 1.8 per cent in July, up 0.2 per cent month-on-month, and 2.1 per cent in January-July, so prices are generally stable.",
ifeng0812.news.49767909_0,E-16,一年以来，汇改成果显著，人民币汇率保持基本稳定，同时也为推动人民币国际化奠定了基础。从市场表现来看，一年来，人民币汇率双向浮动特征明显，汇率弹性增强，汇率预期总体平稳。汇改至今，人民币对美元中间价超百点的上下波动屡屡出现，但过程升贬交替。去年“8·11”汇改之前的最后一次汇改措施实施于2005年，十年间人民币对美元显著升值。新汇改实施以来，人民币改变了之前升值状态，一年间人民币汇率中间价贬值约8％。今年10月1日，国际货币基金组织将正式接纳人民币，成为ＳＤＲ（特别提款权）权重货币。本周，中国海关总署公布的统计数据显示，今年前7个月，中国进出口总值13.21万亿元人民币，比去年同期下降3％。而在7月当月，中国进出口总值同比仅下降0.9％，特别是出口同比增长了2.9％。相关专家认为，尽管7月进出口有企稳迹象，但不应有过高预期。7月，中国进出口总值2.09万亿元人民币，同比下降0.9％。其中，出口1.22万亿元人民币，增长2.9％；进口8730亿元人民币，下降5.7％；贸易顺差3428亿元，扩大34％。尽管进出口总值同比依然下降，但出口数据出现了增长，这也是自今年3月以来，出口实现连续第五个月增长。,"Since a year ago, the results of the exchange rate reform have been significant. The RMB exchange rate has remained generally stable. The reform has also laid the foundation for advancing the internationalization of the RMB at the same time. In terms of market performance, the RMB exchange rate's characteristic of fluctuating both ways is apparent. The exchange rate's elasticity has increased and is expected to remain generally stable. To date, the exchange rate reform has seen the median price of the RMB: USD exchange rate repeatedly fluctuating at more than 100 basis points, with intermittent appreciation and depreciation. The last exchange rate reform measures prior to the ""8.11"" exchange rate reform last year were implemented in 2005. In the last 10 years, the RMB has appreciated significantly against the USD. Since the new currency reforms, Renminbi reversed its appreciation and its central parity rate dropped by about 8% within an year. On October 1 this year, the International Monetary Fund will officially include the RMB as a currency in the SDR (Special Drawing Rights) basket. Figures announced by the General Administration of Customs this week revealed that for the first seven months of this year, China's total imports and exports fell 3% year-on-year to RMB13.21 trillion. Also in July, the sum of export and import decreased only 0.9% y-o-y, while export increased 2.9% during the same time. Some experts believe that although imports and exports in July exhibited signs of stability, overly optimistic expectations should be avoided. In July, China's total import and export amounted to RMB2.09 trillion, down 0.9% year-on-year. In which exports amounted to 1.22 trillion RMB for a 2.9% growth; imports amounted to 873.0 billion RMB, decreasing by 5.7%; and trade surplus amounted to 342.8 billion RMB for a 34% growth. Although total imports and exports have decreased compared to the same period last year, data for export value has increased. This is the fifth consecutive month with growth in exports since March this year.","Over the past year, the results of the exchange rate reform have been remarkable, and the RMB exchange rate has remained basically stable. At the same time, it has laid a foundation for promoting the internationalization of the renminbi. From the market performance point of view, over the past year, the two-way floating characteristics of the RMB exchange rate is obvious, the exchange rate flexibility increased, the exchange rate is expected to be generally stable. Since the reform of the exchange rate, the RMB against the United States dollar more than 100 points up and down fluctuations frequently occur, but the process of rising and falling alternately. The last change before the August 11, 2005, was a significant appreciation of the renminbi against the dollar over the past decade. Since the implementation of the new exchange rate reform, the renminbi has changed its previous state of appreciation, with the midpoint value of the renminbi depreciating by about 8 per cent over the course of a year. On October 1, the International Monetary Fund will officially accept the renminbi as a SDR (Special Drawing Rights) weighted currency. This week, statistics released by China's General Administration of Customs showed that China's imports and exports totaled 13.21 trillion yuan in the first seven months of this year, down 3 percent from the same period last year. In the same month in July, the value of China's imports and exports fell by only 0.9 per cent year-on-year, particularly as exports grew by 2.9 per cent year-on-year. Experts believe that despite signs of stabilization in exports and imports in July, expectations should not be too high. In July, the total value of China's imports and exports was 2.09 trillion yuan, down 0.9 percent year-on-year. Of this total, exports amounted to 1.22 trillion yuan, an increase of 2.9 per cent; imports amounted to 873 billion yuan, a decrease of 5.7 per cent; and the trade surplus amounted to 342.8 billion yuan, an increase of 34 per cent. Although the total value of imports and exports still fell year-on-year, the export figures showed an increase, marking the fifth consecutive monthly increase in exports since March this year.",

Little is known, however, that a strong solar storm, also during the Cold War, nearly led the United States to launch a nuclear war against the Soviet Union, an event that was first made public by researchers on August 9. On May 23, 1967, a powerful solar storm caused intense interference with the U.S. military's radar and radio communications in the Arctic. The radars are part of a U.S. ballistic missile early warning system used to monitor Soviet missiles. The paper, by researchers at the University of Colorado, interviewed U.S. military personnel involved in forecasting and analyzing solar activity at the time, and reviewed non-classified literature. In the 1960s, to prevent a sudden nuclear war by the Soviet Union, the US Air Force always had a portion of warplanes carrying nuclear warheads flying in the sky, the paper wrote. Unaware that the main culprit for the disturbance was a solar storm rather than the Soviet Union, the US military commander ordered that the warplanes be put into combat readiness. Fortunately, the US military's research into solar activity and its electromagnetic interference with the Earth, which began in the late 1950s, eventually stopped this potential military conflict. Later, he compiled the information provided by the U.S. Air Force's Aviation Weather Service and submitted a detailed report. As a direct consequence of the solar storm, the United States military has since regarded space weather as an operational concern and has established a more robust space weather forecasting system.",human

But she did everything she could to swim toward the little girl. Huang Yilin said that the river was muddy and rapid. She was almost spent swimming a distance of less than 5 meters. She used her entire strength to push the little girl to the side of the levee. ""The slope is so slipper. I thought I might sink when I run out of power.""

Renovations created the athletic cultural park that will be  formally opened to public visitors in November, providing fellow citizens with a place to exercise. This has undoubtedly heralded a new place for total public participation in athleticism. One could not help but recall Hangzhou Chen Jinglun Sport School.

New famous athletes are constantly generated in the swimming pool, providing a lively demonstration of the relationship between the competitive sport and public athleticism. A large base of participating public provide an excellent condition for selecting professional athletes. The level of competitive sports is closely linked to public athleticism. Competitive sports, to some degree, is determined by public athleticism, and public athleticism is itself determined by the quality of sporting venues. According to reports, although the average sports venue area per capita in our country as of the end of 2015 was 150 times of that at the founding of the New China, the current figure is still way behind leading athletic nations. In June this year, the State Council of the People's Republic of China released the National Fitness Program (2016-2020) to establish the development of public athleticism as a priority. To compensate for this defect, relevant departments must fully consider the layout of the sports hall during urban planning. On the one hand, the public sports stadium has been built, including sports stadiums in entities such as schools. The scope should be expanded to the fullest extent possible, and utilization rates raised as much as possible.

On National Fitness Day, the South Losing Horse Camp Sports and Cultural Park outside the Wangjiang River in Hangzhou, unveiled the mystery. It used to be a coal mine and has been idle since it closed more than a decade ago, leaving behind a large amount of illegal construction and domestic waste. After its renovation, it has become a sports and cultural park and will officially open to the public in November, providing sports venues free of charge to the public and undoubtedly opening up a whole new fertile ground for sport for all. This is reminiscent of Hangzhou Chenjinglun Sports School, the ""Huangpu Military Academy"" in Chinese swimming, which has won several world championships. Swimming stars are constantly emerging, vividly illustrating the relationship between competitive sports and national sports - the rich mass base provides good conditions for the selection of professional athletes. The level of competitive sports is closely related to the foundation of national sports. Competitive sports in a certain sense depends on national sports, which in turn depends on the conditions of the venue. It is reported that as of 2015, China's per capita sports ground area, although it has been 150 times that of the founding of New China, still lags far behind the sports powerhouse. In June this year, the State Council issued the National Fitness Plan (2016-2020), with the development of mass sports as a key element. In order to make up for this shortcoming, on the one hand, the relevant departments in urban planning to take full account of the layout of the sports venues. On the other hand, completed public sports stadiums, including those in institutions such as schools, should be as open as possible and used as efficiently as possible. The Rio Olympics, now in full swing, have inspired enthusiasm for the sport and awakened a sense of participation.",

Village Secretary Su Qifang: Per capita land acreage is rising every year, just 50 acres, now more than 100 acres; per acre efficiency is increasing every year, the income of professional farmers have room to grow every year. The biggest highlight of the rural collective economic reform in southern Jiangsu is to clarify the property rights of rural collective operating assets and to explore the separation of politics and economy. In July 2015, 14 rural economic cooperation organizations in the streets of Anzhen, Xishan District, Wuxi City, conducted ""separate account management"" with their village committees, which performed the management of rural public affairs, while the cooperative organizations were mainly engaged in business operations. The two institutions have two sets of accounts and do not ""tie up boundaries"" with each other, so as to prevent corruption in village cadres' participation in the management of collective assets. Zhu Baoping, deputy director of the Jiangsu Provincial Agriculture Commission, said that the next step in Jiangsu will be to continue to promote the reform of the community joint-stock cooperative system, encourage the joint development of farmers, and establish a mechanism for the operation of democratic power at the village level. Zhu Baoping: Further push forward the reform, engage in community joint-stock cooperation, quantify the assets to the members, fixed to the farmers, to form a clear property rights. Through the Internet +, the implementation of his right to know, the right to participate in decision-making and supervision of democratic management, the implementation of the three rights to farmers, indeed let it become a standard operating mechanism of joint-stock cooperation.

UV not only darkens the skin, it will also cause sunburns. Is there any solution to help the skin make it through military training and avoid sunburns altogether? The external packaging of sunblock cream is often labeled with SPF and PA. SPF refers to the sun protection factor and specifically targets UVB radiation. Common SPF scores include 15, 30, and 50. Products with the PA label are aimed at UVA. Such sunblocks are more effective. Generally, the strength of PA is indicated by the + sign. Each additional + represents a longer duration of effective protection. For oily skin, choose aqueous sunblock with good penetrability. Sunblock sprays are good options as well. For dry skin, use cream-based anti-sunburn products. Those with neutral skin are not subject to stringent regulations. However, sensitive skin will find application of any product to be a hard burden. Purely physical sunblock products are recommended. Remember to apply the sunblock cream half an hour earlier as the anti-sunburn product needs some time before completely penetrating the skin. Military training includes extended exposure to solar radiation. Anti-sunburn cream must be applied once every 2 hours to sustain the effects. Don't get lazy about this. Since the skin has just been sensitized by exposure to the sun, do not use whitening products immediately after military training. For sunburns endured during military training, ice wrapped in towels can be used to cool scorched skin and alleviate local senses of over-heating.","Although it is now the beginning of autumn, but ""autumn tiger"" power seems to be no worse than the summer.

ifeng0812.news.49766908_0,I-13,行业数据显示，2015年煤炭产能总规模接近60亿吨，全国煤炭产能过剩18亿吨。近十年来，国务院前后共发布过5次淘汰过剩与落后产能的通知。虽然前4次没有针对煤炭行业，但目标行业直接与煤炭业产生关系。去年11月到今年1月，秦皇岛5500大卡动力煤价格长期在370元/吨低位徘徊，90%的煤炭企业陷入亏损。而2月份以来，煤价逐步回升，近期秦皇岛动力煤价格更是连续上涨四周，上升到16个月来的高点，一度攀升到每吨436元，比年初上涨近70元。随着价格回升，各界担心随之产生：一批小煤矿会不会复工复产？对此，中国（海南）改革发展研究院经济所所长匡贤明进行了分析与解读。匡贤明：去产能引起了各方的高度关注，今天公布的煤炭行业去产能的成绩单也确实让大家感到比较担心。这三个表层的因素还是反映出了过去我们的增长方式转变相对滞后的原因，就是由政府主导的增长方式至今还没有得到根本性的转变。第二，这也与地方政府的推进力度直接相关，在去产能的过程中，资金和相应的配套措施都要到位，从这个方面看来，不同地区的差异确实比较大。第三，如果目前进度比较慢的一些省份要在下半年赶进度，它们可能会面临较大的风险。在这种情况下，依靠中央奖补资金来推进去产能的进程可能会产生一定负面的影响。首先，去产能不是简单的进行总量控制。我们的目的是要通过淘汰落后的产能，推进结构的优化，重构整个煤炭行业的新业态。在部署去产能的过程中，地方政府一定要把去产能和煤炭产业的转型升级结合起来，大力发展相关的服务业。第二，要想在今年年内完成今年的去产能任务，我们还是要充分发挥行政监督和行政监察的力量。最后，我们要加强社会保障的兜底作用。因为市场直接涉及到就业的问题，所以我们要加强对员工和职工的就业技能培训。,"Industry figures revealed that in 2015, coal production capacity totaled approximately 6 billion tonnes, with excess capacity of 1.8 billion tonnes nationwide. For nearly 10 years, the State Council of the People's Republic of China have announced 5 notices for eliminating redundant and obsolete production capacities. Although the coal industry was not the target in the first four times, the targeted industries were directly related to coal industry production. From November last year to January this year, the Qinhuangdao 5,500 kcal steam coal has been fluctuating around a price of 370 Yuan/ton, and 90% of coal industries are experiencing losses. Since February, coal prices have started to rebound. The price of steam coal at Qinhuangdao has risen for 4 consecutive weeks, reaching a peak during the last 16 months at a price of 436 Yuan per ton, a figure that almost rose by 70 Yuan compared to the start of the year. As prices rebound, concerns have arisen: Will some of the small coal mines resume production? Kuang Xianming, director of the China Institute for Reform and Development (Hainan), analyzed and interpreted this. Kuang Xianming: Elimination of excess capacity caught everyone's attention. The report card on the elimination of excess capacity in the coal industry announced today has indeed caused greater concern. These three superficial factors still reflect the lag in the change in our growth model, i.e., the government driven growth model has yet to experience a fundamental change to date. Second, it is directly related to the advance effort exerted by the local government. Cutting industrial overcapacity requires proper supportive measures which are varied in different places. Third, if some of the provinces which are currently progressing at a slower rate expect to catch up in the second half, they would face bigger risks. Under such straits, reliance on rewards and compensations from the central government to further increase production capacity will generate a certain degree of negative impact. First, removing production capacity is not simply controlling total volume. Our aim is to get rid of obsolete production capacity, achieve structural optimization, and re-organize the coal industry into a new business form. The local government, during the deployment of overcapacity cutting, shall combine the effort with the transformation of coal industry to drive the development of related service sector. Secondly, to complete the task of reducing production capacities this year, we must ensure thorough enforcement of our administrative supervision and administrative monitoring capacities. Finally, we must strengthen miscellaneous provisions and functions of social programs. As the market is directly related to employment issues, we must strengthen employable skill training for the employees and vocational workers.","Industry data show that total coal production capacity in 2015 was nearly 6 billion tons, with a national surplus of 1.8 billion tons of coal capacity. Over the past decade, the State Council has issued a total of five times before and after the elimination of excess and backward production capacity. Although the first four times did not target the coal industry, but the target industry has a direct relationship with the coal industry. Between November last year and January, Qinhuangdao's 5,500 kilocalories of thermal coal prices hovered at a low of 370 yuan / ton for a long time, with 90 percent of coal companies in the red. And since February, coal prices gradually recovered, the recent Qinhuangdao thermal coal prices rose for four consecutive weeks, rose to a 16-month high, once climbed to 436 yuan per ton, up nearly 70 yuan from the beginning of the year. As prices recovered, concerns arose about whether a group of small coal mines would return to work and return to production. In this regard, China (Hainan) Reform and Development Research Institute, Director of the Institute of Economics Kuang Xianming conducted analysis and interpretation. Quang Xianming: De-capacity has attracted a lot of attention from all sides, and today's announcement of the coal industry's report card for de-capacity has really made people feel more worried. These three superficial factors still reflect the fact that the transformation of our growth pattern has lagged behind in the past, that is, the government-led growth pattern has not yet been fundamentally transformed. Second, this is also directly related to the local government's efforts to promote, in the process of capacity removal, the funds and corresponding supporting measures have to be in place, from this perspective, the differences between different regions are indeed relatively large. Third, some provinces that are currently making slower progress may be at greater risk if they are to catch up in the second half of the year. In this case, relying on central incentive funds to advance the process of capacity removal may have a certain negative impact. First of all, capacity reduction is not simply a matter of total quantity control. Our aim is to reconfigure the new format of the entire coal industry by eliminating backward production capacity and promoting the optimization of the structure. In the process of deploying desalination capacity, local governments must combine desalination capacity with the transformation and upgrading of the coal industry and vigorously develop the relevant service industries. Second, if we want to complete this year's desalination task within this year, we still have to give full play to the strength of administrative supervision and administrative supervision. Finally, we should strengthen the role of social security. Because the market is directly related to the issue of employment, so we should strengthen the employment skills training for employees and workers.",

ifeng0812.news.49765988_0,I-15,8月12日上午，国务院新闻办就2016年7月份国民经济运行情况举行新闻发布会。国家统计局新闻发言人、国民经济综合统计司司长盛来运表示，7月份，国民经济部分指标增速有所放缓，但仍运行在合理区间。国家统计局发布的数据显示，7月份固定资产投资增速、进口总额等数据有所回落。盛来运说，关于7月份的国民经济运行情况，我想借用总理曾经讲过的一句话“形有波动，势仍向好”，这能够比较好地概括7月份的经济运行的特征。他解释“形有波动”是指7月份部分经济指标增速确实是有所回落。因为7月份国内外经济仍处在深度调整之中，国际形势复杂多变，世界经济的复苏不及预期，所以出口压力还是比较大。从国内情况看，整个经济还处在调整的关键阶段，调整的阵痛在释放，经济面临不小的下行压力，所以有些指标有些波动。盛来运指出，7月份还有一个特殊情况，洪涝灾害比较严重，高温酷暑天气对一些地区的生产经营带来了一些影响。根据民政部最近发布的情况，全国6000多万人受灾，直接经济损失超过2000亿元。从工业、投资、交通运输相关指标看，这些地区不同程度受到影响。7月份的货物周转运量增速比上月回落3.6个百分点，洪涝灾害对这些地区的交通有一定的影响。从这些因素来看，7月份部分指标出现波动也是很正常，也是在预期之中。他表示，“势仍向好”指的是尽管经济增速有所回落，但是经济运行总体平稳，稳中有进、稳中向好的大势没有变。7月份CPI上涨1.8%，环比上涨0.2%;1-7月份CPI上涨2.1%，所以物价形势总体稳定。,"On the morning of August 12, the State Council Information Office held a press conference on the operating conditions of the nation's economy in July 2016. Sheng Laiyun, National Bureau of Statistics Spokesman and Deputy Director-General of the Department of Comprehensive Statistics said that a number of national economic indicators grew at a slower rate in July but were still operating within a reasonable range. Figures from the National Bureau of Statistics revealed that fixed asset investment growth, total imports and other data declined again in July. Sheng Laiyun said, ""As far as the operating condition of the national economy in July is concerned, I would like to borrow a phrase from the Premier, and that is 'fluctuations exist but the trend remains positive'. This can better encapsulate the characteristics of the economy in July."" He explained that ""fluctuations exist in the trend"" refers to the fact that the growth rates of some of the July economic indicators have indeed declined. The pressure on exporting sector is still huge due to the  drastic adjustment of domestic and international economy in July, profound change of international situation and the  world economic recovery failed the expectation. Domestically, the entire economy is still going through adjustments, and some adverse reactions to this adjustment have surfaced. Some indicators may fluctuate as the economy faces significant downward pressure. Sheng Laiyun pointed out the occurrence of extraordinary events in July: floods were worse than usual, and the hot weather and high temperatures affected production and the operations of some regions. Latest information released by the Ministry of Civil Affairs showed that the disaster has affected over 60 million people and led to a direct economic loss of over 200 billion RMB. These regions have been affected to varying degrees based on relevant industrial, investment and transportation indicators. The growth in inventory turnover volume in July dropped 3.6% compared to last month. The flooding disaster has imposed a certain degree of influence to traffic in these areas. These factors show that volatility in some of the indicators in July is normal and within expectations. He said that the ""trend is still positive"" meant that although economic growth has decelerated, the economy was running steadily on the whole. The general trend of improvement amid stability and growing positively amid stability remained unchanged. CPI rose by 1.8% in July, and grew by 0.2% when compared to the previous period. CPI from January to July rose by 2.1%. These figures indicate that trends for commodity prices have, in general, remained steady.","On the morning of August 12, the Information Office of the State Council held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in July 2016. Sheng Laiyun, spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics and director of the General Statistics Department of the National Economy, said that the growth rate of some indicators of the national economy had slowed in July, but it was still operating within a reasonable range. Figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics show that the growth rate of fixed-asset investment and total imports fell in July. Sheng Laiyun said that with regard to the performance of the national economy in July, I would like to borrow a phrase once spoken by the Prime Minister, ""The situation is fluctuating and the trend is still positive,"" which can better summarize the characteristics of the economic operation in July. He explained that ""volatility"" refers to the fact that the growth rate of some economic indicators did decline in July. Because the domestic and foreign economies were still undergoing deep adjustment in July, the international situation was complicated and changeable, and the recovery of the world economy was less than expected, so the pressure on exports was still relatively strong. Domestically, the economy as a whole is still in the crucial stage of adjustment, the pain of adjustment is being released and the economy is facing considerable downward pressure, so some indicators are somewhat volatile. Sheng noted that there was also a special situation in July, with more severe flooding and severe heat, which had some impact on production and operations in some areas. According to a recent release by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people across the country have been affected by the disaster, with direct economic losses of more than 200 billion yuan. These areas are affected to varying degrees in terms of industrial, investment and transport-related indicators. The growth rate of goods turnover in July fell 3.6 percentage points from the previous month, with flooding having some impact on traffic in these areas. Judging from these factors, it is also normal and expected that some of the indicators will fluctuate in July. He said the ""trend is still positive"" refers to the fact that despite the slowdown in economic growth, the overall economic performance is stable, steady and positive trend has not changed. CPI rose 1.8 per cent in July, up 0.2 per cent month-on-month, and 2.1 per cent in January-July, so prices are generally stable.",
ifeng0812.news.49767909_0,I-16,一年以来，汇改成果显著，人民币汇率保持基本稳定，同时也为推动人民币国际化奠定了基础。从市场表现来看，一年来，人民币汇率双向浮动特征明显，汇率弹性增强，汇率预期总体平稳。汇改至今，人民币对美元中间价超百点的上下波动屡屡出现，但过程升贬交替。去年“8·11”汇改之前的最后一次汇改措施实施于2005年，十年间人民币对美元显著升值。新汇改实施以来，人民币改变了之前升值状态，一年间人民币汇率中间价贬值约8％。今年10月1日，国际货币基金组织将正式接纳人民币，成为ＳＤＲ（特别提款权）权重货币。本周，中国海关总署公布的统计数据显示，今年前7个月，中国进出口总值13.21万亿元人民币，比去年同期下降3％。而在7月当月，中国进出口总值同比仅下降0.9％，特别是出口同比增长了2.9％。相关专家认为，尽管7月进出口有企稳迹象，但不应有过高预期。7月，中国进出口总值2.09万亿元人民币，同比下降0.9％。其中，出口1.22万亿元人民币，增长2.9％；进口8730亿元人民币，下降5.7％；贸易顺差3428亿元，扩大34％。尽管进出口总值同比依然下降，但出口数据出现了增长，这也是自今年3月以来，出口实现连续第五个月增长。,"Since a year ago, the results of the exchange rate reform have been significant. The RMB exchange rate has remained generally stable. The reform has also laid the foundation for advancing the internationalization of the RMB at the same time. In terms of market performance, the RMB exchange rate's characteristic of fluctuating both ways is apparent. The exchange rate's elasticity has increased and is expected to remain generally stable. To date, the exchange rate reform has seen the median price of the RMB: USD exchange rate repeatedly fluctuating at more than 100 basis points, with intermittent appreciation and depreciation. The last exchange rate reform measures prior to the ""8.11"" exchange rate reform last year were implemented in 2005. In the last 10 years, the RMB has appreciated significantly against the USD. Since the new currency reforms, Renminbi reversed its appreciation and its central parity rate dropped by about 8% within an year. On October 1 this year, the International Monetary Fund will officially include the RMB as a currency in the SDR (Special Drawing Rights) basket. Figures announced by the General Administration of Customs this week revealed that for the first seven months of this year, China's total imports and exports fell 3% year-on-year to RMB13.21 trillion. Also in July, the sum of export and import decreased only 0.9% y-o-y, while export increased 2.9% during the same time. Some experts believe that although imports and exports in July exhibited signs of stability, overly optimistic expectations should be avoided. In July, China's total import and export amounted to RMB2.09 trillion, down 0.9% year-on-year. In which exports amounted to 1.22 trillion RMB for a 2.9% growth; imports amounted to 873.0 billion RMB, decreasing by 5.7%; and trade surplus amounted to 342.8 billion RMB for a 34% growth. Although total imports and exports have decreased compared to the same period last year, data for export value has increased. This is the fifth consecutive month with growth in exports since March this year.","Over the past year, the results of the exchange rate reform have been remarkable, and the RMB exchange rate has remained basically stable. At the same time, it has laid a foundation for promoting the internationalization of the renminbi. From the market performance point of view, over the past year, the two-way floating characteristics of the RMB exchange rate is obvious, the exchange rate flexibility increased, the exchange rate is expected to be generally stable. Since the reform of the exchange rate, the RMB against the United States dollar more than 100 points up and down fluctuations frequently occur, but the process of rising and falling alternately. The last change before the August 11, 2005, was a significant appreciation of the renminbi against the dollar over the past decade. Since the implementation of the new exchange rate reform, the renminbi has changed its previous state of appreciation, with the midpoint value of the renminbi depreciating by about 8 per cent over the course of a year. On October 1, the International Monetary Fund will officially accept the renminbi as a SDR (Special Drawing Rights) weighted currency. This week, statistics released by China's General Administration of Customs showed that China's imports and exports totaled 13.21 trillion yuan in the first seven months of this year, down 3 percent from the same period last year. In the same month in July, the value of China's imports and exports fell by only 0.9 per cent year-on-year, particularly as exports grew by 2.9 per cent year-on-year. Experts believe that despite signs of stabilization in exports and imports in July, expectations should not be too high. In July, the total value of China's imports and exports was 2.09 trillion yuan, down 0.9 percent year-on-year. Of this total, exports amounted to 1.22 trillion yuan, an increase of 2.9 per cent; imports amounted to 873 billion yuan, a decrease of 5.7 per cent; and the trade surplus amounted to 342.8 billion yuan, an increase of 34 per cent.

This event was regarded as the zenith of the Cold War, and was known in history as the ""Cuban missile crisis"". What was little known was that during the Cold War, a strong solar storm almost sparked a nuclear war between the US and the Soviet Union. This was only publicly disclosed by researchers for the first time on August 9. On May 23, 1967, a powerful solar storm caused severe disruptions to a North Pole radar station and radio communications of the US military. This radar is part of the US ballistic missile early warning system, and is used to monitor Soviet missiles. This thesis, completed by researchers at the University of Colorado, interviewed US military personnel who took part in forecasting and analyzing the sun's activities at the time, as well as consulted unclassified documents. The article said the U.S. Air Force kept fighters loaded with nuclear warhead patrolling in the air in 1960s to prevent any sudden nuclear war waged by the U.S.S.R The US military commander was unaware that the interference was caused by a solar storm and not the Soviet Union, and thus gave orders for all military aircraft to enter combat status. Fortunately, the potential military conflict was avoided by the study of solar activity and its electromagnetic interference to earth conducted by U.S.army from the end of 1950s. He then compiled the information provided by the US Air Force Air Weather Service and submitted a detailed report. The direct consequence of the solar storm is that the US military began viewing space weather as a key component of battle, and established a more powerful space weather early warning system.","During the Cold War, the Soviet Union brought missiles into Cuba, which almost led to a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union.

But she did everything she could to swim toward the little girl. Huang Yilin said that the river was muddy and rapid. She was almost spent swimming a distance of less than 5 meters. She used her entire strength to push the little girl to the side of the levee. ""The slope is so slipper. I thought I might sink when I run out of power.""

The mysterious veil over the Nanluomaying Sports Cultural Park outside Wangjiang Gate of Hangzhou was lifted on National Fitness Day. This used to be a coal mine, and was left idle after it closed down more than 10 years ago. What remained were numerous illegal buildings and domestic waste. Renovations created the athletic cultural park that will be  formally opened to public visitors in November, providing fellow citizens with a place to exercise. This has undoubtedly heralded a new place for total public participation in athleticism. One could not help but recall Hangzhou Chen Jinglun Sport School. This ""Huangpu Military Academy"" of the Chinese swimming world has produced many world champions. New famous athletes are constantly generated in the swimming pool, providing a lively demonstration of the relationship between the competitive sport and public athleticism. A large base of participating public provide an excellent condition for selecting professional athletes. The level of competitive sports is closely linked to public athleticism. Competitive sports, to some degree, is determined by public athleticism, and public athleticism is itself determined by the quality of sporting venues. According to reports, although the average sports venue area per capita in our country as of the end of 2015 was 150 times of that at the founding of the New China, the current figure is still way behind leading athletic nations. In June this year, the State Council of the People's Republic of China released the National Fitness Program (2016-2020) to establish the development of public athleticism as a priority. To compensate for this defect, relevant departments must fully consider the layout of the sports hall during urban planning. On the one hand, the public sports stadium has been built, including sports stadiums in entities such as schools. The scope should be expanded to the fullest extent possible, and utilization rates raised as much as possible. The Rio Olympics is currently all the rage, and has inspired public passion for sports as well as awakened the people's desire to participate in athletic activities.","Completing short boards of public sports facilities Black coal warehouse, into a ""green grass"" football field; red brick spire of the plant, into a modern sports hall. On National Fitness Day, the South Losing Horse Camp Sports and Cultural Park outside the Wangjiang River in Hangzhou, unveiled the mystery. It used to be a coal mine and has been idle since it closed more than a decade ago, leaving behind a large amount of illegal construction and domestic waste. After its renovation, it has become a sports and cultural park and will officially open to the public in November, providing sports venues free of charge to the public and undoubtedly opening up a whole new fertile ground for sport for all. This is reminiscent of Hangzhou Chenjinglun Sports School, the ""Huangpu Military Academy"" in Chinese swimming, which has won several world championships. Swimming stars are constantly emerging, vividly illustrating the relationship between competitive sports and national sports - the rich mass base provides good conditions for the selection of professional athletes. The level of competitive sports is closely related to the foundation of national sports. Competitive sports in a certain sense depends on national sports, which in turn depends on the conditions of the venue. It is reported that as of 2015, China's per capita sports ground area, although it has been 150 times that of the founding of New China, still lags far behind the sports powerhouse. In June this year, the State Council issued the National Fitness Plan (2016-2020), with the development of mass sports as a key element. In order to make up for this shortcoming, on the one hand, the relevant departments in urban planning to take full account of the layout of the sports venues. On the other hand, completed public sports stadiums, including those in institutions such as schools, should be as open as possible and used as efficiently as possible. The Rio Olympics, now in full swing, have inspired enthusiasm for the sport and awakened a sense of participation.",

Twelve workers and one technician are enough for the 150mu groove with 10 varieties. Last year, the total amount of money was fifty thousand. At my age, I definitely couldn't make this amount of money if I were to work at a factory. Last year, village-level revenue of Donglin Village reached 22.00 million, of which agricultural income accounted for nearly half of this figure. Village Secretary Su Qifang: arable land area per capita is rising each year. It was 50 mu initially, and more than 100 mu now; average efficiency per mu is also rising annually. There is also room for the income of professional farmers to grow each year as well. Shares have been quantified and distributed to every villager. The biggest highlight of the Sunan Rural Collective Economy Reform is clearly stipulating the ownership of business operation assets of the rural collective and investigating the separation of politics and economy. The 14 Rural Economic Cooperatives（REC) in Anzhen Neighborhood, Xishan Dis., Wuxi and their corresponding village committees adopted the "" account-divided management"" from July, 2015.

This will prevent village officials from engaging in corrupt practices when  managing collective assets.

Zhu Baoping: Expand the scope of reforms, implement community shareholding and partnerships, ensure that assets are distributed to community members, ensure fixed shareholding benefits to the farmers, and establish a clear ownership over the industry.

UV not only darkens the skin, it will also cause sunburns. Is there any solution to help the skin make it through military training and avoid sunburns altogether? The external packaging of sunblock cream is often labeled with SPF and PA. SPF refers to the sun protection factor and specifically targets UVB radiation. Common SPF scores include 15, 30, and 50. Products with the PA label are aimed at UVA. Such sunblocks are more effective. Generally, the strength of PA is indicated by the + sign. Each additional + represents a longer duration of effective protection. For oily skin, choose aqueous sunblock with good penetrability. Sunblock sprays are good options as well. For dry skin, use cream-based anti-sunburn products. Those with neutral skin are not subject to stringent regulations. However, sensitive skin will find application of any product to be a hard burden. Purely physical sunblock products are recommended. Remember to apply the sunblock cream half an hour earlier as the anti-sunburn product needs some time before completely penetrating the skin. Military training includes extended exposure to solar radiation. Anti-sunburn cream must be applied once every 2 hours to sustain the effects. Don't get lazy about this. Since the skin has just been sensitized by exposure to the sun, do not use whitening products immediately after military training. For sunburns endured during military training, ice wrapped in towels can be used to cool scorched skin and alleviate local senses of over-heating.","Although it is now the beginning of autumn, but ""autumn tiger"" power seems to be no worse than the summer.

Sunscreen packaging is generally marked SPF and PA, SPF refers to the sun protection index, is for UVB ultraviolet rays, our common SPF index is 15, 30, 50, and so on.

According to the Forestry Department of Jilin, the 1998 data from a joint monitoring exercise by China, the US and Russia showed that there were only four to six Siberian tigers, and three to five Amur leopards living in the wild in Jilin Province. According to Yu Changchun, director of the conservation section of the Jilin Forestry Department, said that Jilin Province has been expanding protection efforts for the wildlife. The populations of the northeastern tiger and northeastern leopard have achieved significant growth and their ranges have been growing as well. Data from the latest monitoring in 2015 revealed that 27 Siberian tigers and 42 Amur leopards living in the wild were detected within Jilin Province. As flagship species of World Animal Protection distributed across the China-Russia border, the China-Russia partnership is especially meaningful to restore and increase the populations of northeastern tigers and leopards.
